DSA Final Project - Team: Los cachetones.

We are trying to find a way to help a student try to find which major would best fit their interests, based on the results of the choice that they input into a multiple choice based quiz that would align them with their major.

Hence why we have created the ultimate Major Picker!!

Instructions to run Code:
Code runs natively on the console in C++. Simply clone the  repository (Dataset file as a csv is already included in the repo which is accessed as a relative path). NO extra instructions or frameowrks is needed besides a C++ compiler!
